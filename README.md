# FinAware
Prototyping for the CASSINI Hackathon 2022

The FinAware solution integrates publicly available satelite measurements from the Copernicus project (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/swi) with publicly available land-use registry from The Finnish Food Authority (https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/about-us/open-information/inspire/) to provide an individualize Climate Risk Factor for any give crop (asset of interest AoI) and any given region (region of interest RoI).

## Demo data
The Risk factor is lower on years with higher moisture and less variability (see Figure). Three adjacent 1km2 points from the same parcel.
